# Rotating ASCII Cube

This is a script originally written in C (https://github.com/tarantino07/cube.c)! 

I translated the idea into Zig 0.15.1 as a learning experience and personal challenge. Added a yScale constant that allows the cube to compensate for the width and height difference of the CLI characters.
